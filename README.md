# Comment Parser

Software package to extract glosses from Classical Chinese commentaries. 

The glosses are collected in a stand-alone html page, a compressed version of which can be found by clicking on `v0.0.1` under Releases and then downloading the file `dict.zip`. 

This project includes texts from 中華電子佛典協會 (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association CBETA) http://cbeta.org.
